From the given data the three facts we can determine would be firstly, the best time to do a startup would be in the summer between June and July and the worst time would be in fall and winter between September and Febuary. Secondly the most successful startups are theater and music and lastly that overall there is a much higher rate of successfull startups then failures or cancels. 
One limitation of the data would be the exact genre of startup, while plays are the most successful no information is given on what type of plays are successful and which are not.
One point of data that would add value would be genre which further defines the subgroup catagory, this data could give more insight into what type of specific plays or musicals are failing and which are more popular.

I think median is a better summary of data becasue mean can be affected by outliers whereas median is the middle value.
Failed startups have higher variance and I think the reason is because the range of failure is much higher than the range of success because failure can range from 0 to 99% of goal reached.
